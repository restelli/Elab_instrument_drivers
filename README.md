# Elab_instrument_drivers
A collection of Python drivers to talk with the instrumentation in the JQI Electronics lab

At the moment I added some stub control code for DSO-X 3034A. That's it.
In the future the goal is to refactor that code, make this repo into a pip/nix installable module and add functions and instruments
